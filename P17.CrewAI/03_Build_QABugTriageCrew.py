# # Sample bug report

# Bug Title: Shopping cart total shows $0.00 after applying discount code
# Bug ID: BUG-4521
# Reporter: manual_tester_jane
# Environment: Production, Chrome 120, Windows 11
# Severity (Reporter): High

# Steps to Reproduce:
# 1. Add 3+ items to shopping cart (total > $50)
# 2. Apply discount code "SAVE20" (20% off)
# 3. Observe the cart total

# Actual Result: Cart total shows $0.00 instead of discounted price
# Expected Result: Cart total should show original price minus 20%

# Additional Info:
# - Happens only when cart has 3+ items
# - Works fine with 1-2 items
# - Started after last Friday's deployment (v2.4.1)
# - No errors in browser console
# - API response shows correct discounted amount
